# BillingBots

Note: ***Always keep your personal data safe and secure. For the purpose of demonstration this experiment was done with a prepaid credit card and an account that is older which had an outstanding balance before porting to a new provider. All my other providers are using a similar bot for which i created for them but i keep those private and secure. It is your responsibility to keep your information private and secure. This is strictly for educational purposes. Use at own risk***

If you are a customer for Bell Canada, you can use this bot as is and customize a few settings.

1) Change the payment threshold in the makepayments method
2) Create your own secrets.py file
3) If you want a tutorial on how to use this bot then check out this video --> https://youtu.be/HsA0mJ4kNKE
